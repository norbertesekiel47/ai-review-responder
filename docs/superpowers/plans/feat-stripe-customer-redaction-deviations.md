# Deviations — feat/stripe-customer-redaction

## D1 — the armed ladder carried a stale classification

**What happened.** `scripts/feature-setup.sh:88` runs
`progress.mjs carry "$PARENT_ROOT"`, which copied the parent checkout's
`.feature/progress.json` into the worktree. That file held `epic·high·ui`
from an earlier, unrelated run, so the armed worktree reported the wrong
lane even though `.feature/intake.json` correctly held
`standard·high·backend`. `.feature/LADDER-NOTE.md` records the same class of
bug from 2026-09-02; renaming the stale file fixed one instance, and the file
was recreated since.

**What I did.** Re-ran `progress.mjs init --size standard --risk high
--surface backend` inside the worktree. The step history survived, because
`init` preserves an existing `steps` object. The intake was never wrong and
was not edited.

**Impact on the feature.** None. The ladder is reporting metadata only.

**Verdict:** ACCEPT
