# Deviations — feat/stripe-customer-redaction

## D1 — the armed ladder carried a stale classification

**What happened.** `scripts/feature-setup.sh:88` runs
`progress.mjs carry "$PARENT_ROOT"`, which copied the parent checkout's
`.feature/progress.json` into the worktree. That file held `epic·high·ui`
from an earlier, unrelated run, so the armed worktree reported the wrong
lane even though `.feature/intake.json` correctly held
`standard·high·backend`. `.feature/LADDER-NOTE.md` records the same class of
bug from 2026-09-02; renaming the stale file fixed one instance, and the file
was recreated since.

**What I did.** Re-ran `progress.mjs init --size standard --risk high
--surface backend` inside the worktree. The step history survived, because
`init` preserves an existing `steps` object. The intake was never wrong and
was not edited.

**Impact on the feature.** None. The ladder is reporting metadata only.

**Verdict:** ACCEPT

## D2 — my own `verification_commands` broke the gate

**What happened.** The first baseline gate went RED on
`extra-pnpm-test-worker-jobs-account-offboardin-cd840c`:
`offboarding-lifecycle.integration.test.ts:1543` expected a
`solicitation_suppressions` verification issue and instead saw
`accounts`/`businesses`/`users` each with `violationCount: 1`. The tree was
docs-only at the time, so nothing in this branch could have caused it.

**Root cause.** The three `verification_commands` I put in the intake each
spawn a separate `vitest run`, and the gate executes its `extra-*` rows in
PARALLEL. Two of those rows reach live-DB offboarding suites. Vitest's
serialized `integration` project only serializes suites WITHIN a single run,
so three concurrent vitest processes against one Postgres test database
interfere — the class `.claude/CLAUDE.md` warns about under the live-DB suite
conventions. A compounding factor: `scripts/verify-gate.sh:255` provisions the
test DB only when the diff is not docs-only, but lines 247-249 export
`TEST_DATABASE_POOL_URL` unconditionally, so the suites ran against an
unprovisioned database.

**Proof.** Run alone without the DB: 86 passed, 2 skipped. Run alone WITH
`TEST_DATABASE_POOL_URL` exported: 88/88 passed. The suite is green at HEAD;
only the parallel gate run failed it.

**What I did.** Cleared `verification_commands` to `[]` in both intake copies.
The gate's own `pnpm test` row already runs every suite with the correct
serialization, so the three commands added no coverage and actively broke the
gate. This is an intake correction, not a surface amendment, so it does not
count against the amendment budget.

**Impact on the feature.** None on behaviour. It removes a false-red source
from every future gate run on this branch.

**Verdict:** ACCEPT
