# Deviations — feat-632-review-attributed-shadow

Entries the plan did not anticipate. Step 6 reads this end to end before review
and logs an ACCEPT / RE-PLAN verdict on each.

---

## D1 — `attribution_rule TEXT` replaces the intake preview's `attribution_score NUMERIC(4,3)`

**Stage:** planning (step 3), before any code.
**What changed:** the migration-114 column set.
**Why:** the intake question's schema preview was written before the match-rule
fork was answered. The owner then locked the strict two-rule matcher with **no
scored fallback**, so a score column would have shipped with no writer — dead
schema on a table the whole send lane reads. The rule name is what May §6.4's
M3 precision bar will slice by, so it carries the information a score would
have.
**Scope impact:** none. Same column count, same migration, same CHECK arity.
**Verdict:** _pending step 6._

## D2 — `attribution_detail` carries no personal data

**Stage:** planning (step 3).
**What changed:** the JSONB evidence shape. No `reviewer_name`, no
`contact_name`.
**Why:** both names already live in their own tables and the owner surface
joins for them. Denormalizing the reviewer name would make it **survive the
review's deletion** — migration 114's FK is `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so the row
persists. That is exactly the retention leak the **Body redaction** discipline
exists to prevent, and it would have created a copy no sweep reaches.
**Scope impact:** none.
**Verdict:** _pending step 6._

## D3 — the enqueue guard is time-unbounded, and the payload drops `account_id`

**Stage:** planning (step 3), found by the orchestrator while round 1 ran.
**What changed:** three things in Task 4, all forced by the same reading.

1. The planned guard `sent_at > NOW() - 14 days` is **not** the superset the
   plan claimed. The candidate window is anchor-relative
   (`LEAST(review_date, detected_at)`), so a review posted 13 days ago and
   detected today makes an ask sent 20 days ago a legitimate candidate — while
   the `NOW()`-relative guard is false and no job is ever enqueued. Silent data
   loss. The guard is now `delivery_status = 'sent' AND attributed_review_id IS
   NULL` with no time bound, which is provably a superset of every candidate.
2. That removes the `eligibilityWindowDays` parameter, so
   `src/lib/shared/job-outbox-helpers.ts` needs neither a window constant nor a
   domain import. The layering workaround the plan designed dissolves.
3. `accountId` is not in scope at the enqueue site —
   `src/lib/reviews/process-review.ts` resolves it inside `startReviewRun`
   (line 203), not at the caller. The payload therefore carries `review_id` +
   `business_id` only, and `attributeReview` resolves the account inside its own
   transaction, as `startReviewRun` and `maybeEnqueueFirstReviewIngested`
   already do. Removes any way a wrong account id could ride a payload.

**Scope impact:** net simpler. One fewer parameter, one fewer payload field, one
fewer cross-module import.
**Verdict:** _pending step 6._

## D4 — the plan cited `reviewTimeAnchor(sql, 'bare')`; the real signature is `'' | 'r.'`

**Stage:** planning (step 3), cited-artifact check.
**What changed:** the candidate CTE aliases the reviews row as `r` and passes
`'r.'`. `src/lib/kpi/fragments.ts:44` defines `ReviewsPrefix = '' | 'r.'`.
**Why it matters beyond the typo:** the plan had marked this call as unverified
and told the implementer to check it. It was wrong, which is the argument for
keeping that instruction in future plans rather than guessing a signature.
**Scope impact:** none.
**Verdict:** _pending step 6._

---

## D5 — migration 114 must add a per-topic `job_outbox` in-flight index

**Stage:** planning (step 3), cited-artifact check.
**What changed:** migration 114 gains
`job_outbox_solicitation_attribution_inflight`.
**Why:** the `job_outbox` in-flight unique indexes are **per topic**, not
generic — `job_outbox_solicitation_send_inflight` (091:541),
`job_outbox_generate_solicitation_asks_inflight` (091:546),
`job_outbox_solicitation_veto_notice_inflight` (113:24). A new topic with no
index gives the helper's `ON CONFLICT … WHERE topic = … AND status IN (…)` no
constraint to infer, and the INSERT throws at runtime — inside the review-ingest
transaction, which is the one place this feature promised never to break. The
plan had this as an open item; it is now resolved and closed.
**Scope impact:** +6 lines of migration. No change to the migration count or the
in-flight slot.
**Verdict:** _pending step 6._
